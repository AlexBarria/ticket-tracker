# Ticket Tracker üéüÔ∏è

Ticket Tracker is a comprehensive system that allows users to upload receipt photos, which are then processed by an OCR model and an AI agent to structure the data into a database. It also provides an interface for administrators to query expense data using natural language.

This project is built on a **microservices architecture**, with services written in Python (using FastAPI and Streamlit). The entire stack is containerized and orchestrated using Docker and Docker Compose.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the entire microservices stack running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Docker** and **Docker Compose**: Ensure you have Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine with the Compose plugin) installed and running. You can download it [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd TICKET-TRACKER
    ```

2.  **Configure environment variables:**
    The project uses a `.env` file to manage all secrets and configurations. Start by copying the example file.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, **edit the `.env` file** and add your actual credentials for the required services (OpenAI API Key, Auth0 details, etc.).

3.  **Build and Run the Services:**
    This single command will build the container images for each microservice and start the entire application stack in detached mode.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
    The initial build might take a few minutes as it downloads base images and installs dependencies for each service.

### ‚úÖ Accessing the Services

Once all the containers are up and running, you can access the different parts of the system at the following URLs:

| Service               | URL                               | Description                                      |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Admin UI (Streamlit)** | `http://localhost:8501`           | The main web interface for admin queries.        |
| **Agent 2 API Docs** | `http://localhost:8003/docs`      | Swagger UI for the RAG agent API.                |
| **Agent 1 API Docs** | `http://localhost:8002/docs`      | Swagger UI for the Formatter agent API.          |
| **OCR Service API Docs** | `http://localhost:8001/docs`      | Swagger UI for the OCR service API.              |
| **MLflow Tracking UI** | `http://localhost:5001`           | UI for tracking agent runs and experiments.      |
| **MinIO Console (S3)** | `http://localhost:9001`           | Web console for browsing the S3 buckets.         |

## üñ•Ô∏è User Interface & Authentication

The primary interaction with the application is through a web user interface built with Streamlit, accessible at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Authentication Flow

Access to the application is protected and managed by **Auth0**, a robust and secure identity service.

1.  **Login**: Upon accessing the UI, you will be presented with a "Login" button. Clicking it will redirect you to a secure login page hosted by Auth0.
2.  **Credentials**: You must enter the email and password associated with your user account.
3.  **Redirection**: Once your credentials are validated, you will be redirected back to the application with an active session.

### Roles & Permissions

The application uses a role-based access control (RBAC) system to determine which pages and features each user can see. Roles are assigned by a system administrator in the Auth0 dashboard.

* üë§ **`client` Role**: This role is designed for users who only need to upload receipts.
    * **Access**: They can only see the **"Client Uploader"** page to upload their ticket images.

* üëë **`admin` Role**: This role has full access to all application features.
    * **Full Access**: They can see both the **"Client Uploader"** page and the **"Admin Dashboard"**, which allows them to make natural language queries about expense data.

### Logout Process

The "Logout" button performs a federated logout. This means it terminates the session in both the Streamlit application and Auth0, ensuring your account is completely and securely logged out. When you try to access the application again, you will be required to re-enter your credentials.

## üìÇ Project Structure

This project follows a microservices architecture. Each top-level directory represents a self-contained service with its own `Dockerfile` and logic. The `docker-compose.yml` file at the root orchestrates how these services build, run, and communicate.

```
/TICKET-TRACKER
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                  # Holds all secrets & configurations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agent-1-formatter/    # Microservice: Structures OCR text into JSON
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agent-2-rag/          # Microservice: Answers admin queries using RAG
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ minio/                # Configuration and data for MinIO (S3 storage)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ocr-service/          # Microservice: Extracts raw text from images
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ postgres/             # Configuration and data for PostgreSQL DB
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/                   # Microservice: Streamlit frontend for admins

### Core Services Explained

* `docker-compose.yml`: The central orchestrator. It defines all services, how they connect, which ports they expose, and which volumes they use for data persistence.
* `ui/`: A **Streamlit** application that serves as the graphical user interface for administrators to ask questions. It communicates with `agent-2-rag`.
* `agent-1-formatter/`: A **FastAPI** service that receives raw text from the OCR service, uses an LLM (via OpenAI) to structure it into a predefined JSON format, and saves it to the PostgreSQL database.
* `agent-2-rag/`: A **FastAPI** service that implements the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) logic. It receives a natural language question from the UI, translates it into a SQL query, fetches data from the database, and generates a human-readable answer.
* `ocr-service/`: A **FastAPI** service that exposes an OCR model. It accepts an image file and returns the extracted raw text.
* `postgres/`: Contains the configuration for the PostgreSQL database, including an `init-db.sql` script that creates the necessary tables on the first run. Data is persisted in a Docker volume.
* `minio/`: Configuration for the MinIO object storage service, which acts as an S3-compatible server for storing the original receipt images.
* **MLflow**: Defined within `docker-compose.yml` but without a dedicated folder. It's configured to run using the official Docker image, with Postgres as its backend store and MinIO as its artifact store.
